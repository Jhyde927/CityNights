# CityNights

**CityNights** is a pixel-art, adventure game developed in C++ using Raylib. It started as a project to learn C++. I took a pixel art drawing I had made of a city street at night and tried to make it interactive. 

## Features
- **Multiple Locations**: City streets, apartments, a cemetery, and more.
- **Combat**: Fight zombies and other creatures.
- **Inventory System**: Collect items like car keys and a gun.
- **NPC Dialog**: Randomized phrases from NPCs you encounter on the street.
