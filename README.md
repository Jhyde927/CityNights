# DeadCityNights

**DeadCityNights** is point and click, pixel art adventure game developed in C++ using raylib. I needed a project to learn C++ so I took a pixel art image I made of a city street at night and made it into a game. 

## Features
- **Multiple Locations**: City streets, apartment, a cemetery, and more.
- **Combat**: Shoot zombies with guns.
- **Inventory System**: Collect items like car keys and a gun.
- **NPC Dialog**: Randomized phrases from NPCs you encounter on the street.
- **Take Drugs**: Buy drugs off of a dealer on the street.
- **Shader Effect**: Different shader effects will play depending on the situation.
- **Voice Acting**: Custom made zombie grunts and moans.
