## Installation
The release is a very early alpha version. Unzip and run game.exe

## Controls
Arrow keys left and right or A and D to move. Press up to interact with environment. Click on NPCs to talk to them. Right click or F to aim. Left click while aiming to shoot. Guns only work in the cemetery.

## Notes
This started as a project to learn C++. I took a pixel art image I made of a city street at night, and made it into a game. I had an idea that the game would start with you doing mundane tasks like going to work, and helping out NPCs, and sleeping to advance the day. Then when the game reaches a certain date, a zombie apocalypse happens where zombies invade the city street, but for now you can only shoot zombies in the cemetery.

I post about making the game on twitter. https://x.com/J_Hyde_
